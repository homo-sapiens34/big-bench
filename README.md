Systematic benchmarking of bioinformatics tools

The aim of this project is to provide a flexible protocol and unified instruments for iterative benchmarking of bioinformatics tools solving various problems. The results of benchmarking for each particular task are to be published as a blog post. The posts are to be automatically updated each time somebody provide new data on the performance of any considered tool. There should be an ability to add new tools as well as new datasets to an existing comparison.  

*What problem is this project going to solve?* 

Almost every paper presenting a new tool usually provides a comparison of the new program to some old ones. Such comparisons are often unfair. Authors thoughtfully tune the parameters of their own program but use the other tools with the default parameters. As a result, we usually have plenty of tools with no real information about their performance on real datasets. Although for some areas there are some benchmarking studies, they rapidly become outdated as soon as new tools and new datasets emerge. 

Our first area of interest is the estimation of allelic disbalance from RNA-seq data. Some preliminary results of this work one may find in the corresponding folder.
