## Monoallelic expression detection with Kalista and RSEM

This repo contains code for the evaluation of the two programs on *simulated data*. The simulated data consist of two transcriptomes: paternal and maternal, having a fixed rate of dissimilarity; and reads, coming from these transcriptomes in a controlled proportion. We measure how well each program could guess the simulated proportion - allelic disbalance rate.   

The project is in development. All the details and docker image will be added soon. The simulated data could be found by the link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/izjmdwo47sdl15w/AABW2Pj0MNF1sBpPphj_vK65a?dl=0
